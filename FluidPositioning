## Fluid Positioning ##
A method for selecting BP's by EOS Proxies 

A big portion of the EOS community beleives that a stonger flow of BP's from the top 21 positions is beneficial for the EOS ecosystem and the BPs themselves.

The immediate benefits could be enumerated as:
1. All Standby BPs would get a higher probability to get a chance to actually perform their job, and gain necessary experience and readyness. 
2. Active producing BPs can gain needed time "on the pits" for maintenance, hardware & software upgrades, cleaning & re-seating components, etc.
3. 

This flowing process of BP's is actually happening right now "naturally" as big whales and token holders are constantly shifting their wait causing BP repositioning, but is there a way for Voting Proxies to stimulate this flow?
We have deviced a simple ratio-driven mechanism for EOS Voting Proxies that could stimulate a more dynamic up/down flow of BPs.  

EOS EOS BP's are divide into 3 distintive groups:
1 - Top 21 BPs 		- Actually producing the blocks and getting rewarded for it.
2 - Standby BPs 	- Do not produce blocks but get rewarded.
3 - Non-Paid BPs 	- Do not produce blocks and don't get rewarded. 

This is what we call "Fluid Positioning". A simple concept we are incorporating into the mechanics used by the DemTech Proxy.

We have concluded that a 20/60/20 ratio weighted to the middle group would stimulate "Fluid Positioning" the most, but this could change with experience.
In numbers the split would be: 
1. Top 21 BP's get 20% = 6 BP's 
2. Standby BP's get 60% = 18 BP's
3. Non-Paid BP's get 20% = 6 BP's

So the selection procedure will be:
1. Select BP's with strong combinations of the Criteria detailed above.
2. Reduce the BPs list according to the 20/60/20 ratio explained above.

**Caveats:** 
1. This scheme would only be effective if the DemTech Proxy gets enough traction from the community token holders otherwise the influence would be null.
2. The list will have to be updated periodically so it can stimulate up/down flow of BPs.
