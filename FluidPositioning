The Fluid Positioning Concept
-----------------------------

We can divide the EOS BP's into 3 distintive groups:
1 - Top 21 BPs 		- Are actually producing the blocks and getting rewarded for it.
2 - Standby BPs 	- Do not produce blocks but get rewarded.
3 - Non-Paid BPs 	- Do not produce blocks and don't get rewarded. 

We beleive it would be healthy for the EOS network have more dynamic flow of BP's up/down from these three groups.
If this flow of positions could be increased, it would be beneficial for all BP's involved.
1- All Standby BPs would get a higher probability to get a chance to actually perform their job, and gain necessary experience and readyness.
2- Active producing BPs can gain needed time "on the pits" for maintenance, hardware & software upgrades, cleaning & re-seating componets, etc.

This is what we call "Fluid Positioning". A concept we will be incorporating into the Criteria used by the DemTech Proxy.
We would balance the list with the formula 20-60-20. That is Top BP's get 20% = 6 BP's, Standby BP's get 60% = 18 BP's, and Non-Paid BP's get 20% = 6 BP's
So those percentages of each group with strong combinations of the rest of the Criteria will be selected to the DemTech Proxy list.
After calculations, we concluded that a 20/60/20 ratio weighted to the middle group would stimulate "Fluid Positioning" the most.
This scheme would only be effective if the Proxy gets enough traction from the community token holders
