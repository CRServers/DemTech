Democracy Tech EOS Proxy

slogan (string):
"Empowering The Individual Beyond Trust"

philosophy (string):
Blockchain Technology and programmable peer-to-peer networks like EOS make third-party intermediation unnecessary. We now have the opportunity to create in EOS an environment that will facilitate reaching "Individual Sovereignty" for all humankind. The Democracy Tech Proxy will vote for BP's that hold and protect the individual's rights for *Life, *Liberty, *Property, and *Privacy. We will pursue "Dynamic Democracy" so the BP list will change as we periodically evaluate BP's with strong combinations of this criteria: *Independent (Self-Funded), *GeoPolitical Diversity, *Transparency (Disclosure of Ownership & Use of Rewards), *Infrastructure Control (Physical Access and Management), *EOS Software Testing (Testnets, Debugging, Improvements), *Democracy Dapp Development (Government Transparency, Elections, Censored-Resistant Media, Surveillance-Resistance, Identity & Data Privacy), *Community Engagement, *Education & Promotion of EOS Use & Programming, *Compliance (BP Requirements & Constitution Agreement)

background (string):
I graduated from Tulane University in 1973 with degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Philosophy. In 1969 I started programing Fortran IV on IBM mainframes, and  built my own Ham Radio rig to talk to home. That was my first experience with decentralized communications networks. In 1987 I established a software development company and programmed business software for 13 years. Seeing the Internet phenomenon rising, we switched our focus exclusively to Internet. Domain edenia.com registration marks the date as 1995. I have been in the Internet business ever since providing all Internet services to customers worldwide. I discovered Bitcoin in 2013 and my enthusiasm grew exponentially. We promptly adopted BTC as payment for our services. We currently run BTC, DASH, Stellar, Gridcoin, and ZenCash nodes for our customers. I encountered Bitshares in 2015 and Steem in early 2016 and have been using them ever since. I have a strong admiration for Dan Larimer as a software engineer and for his latest creation: EOS
