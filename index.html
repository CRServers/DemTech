<h1>The Democracy Technology EOS Voting Proxy</h1>
<h4>"Empowering The Individual Beyond Trust"</h4>
<br>
<h2>Philosophy:</h2>
<p>Blockchain Technology and programmable peer-to-peer networks like EOS make trust in political and third-party intermediation unnecessary.<br>
We now have the opportunity to create the environment and code in EOS that will facilitate the achievement of <b>"Individual Sovereignty"</b> for all people of the world.
<br /> <br />
<b>The Democracy Technology Proxy</b> will vote for 30 Block producers that best pursue this goal specifically defined as:<br />
<ul>
    <li><b>Liberty and Self-Ownership</b></li>All are free to pursue happiness the way they choose as long as they do not harm others.<br />
    <li><b>Property</b></li>All can own property of all kinds as long as it has been appropiated in free agreements among parties without the use of coersive force. <br />
    <li><b>Liquid Democracy</b></li>All can choose the governance model that best suits them and participate directly in governance, elections, and voting of issues.<br />
    <li><b>Privacy</b></li>All have the right to protect and control their personal identity, valuables, and data.<br />
</ul>
<br />
This proxy will aim at attaining <b>"Liquid Democracy"</b> where the "Wisdom"" of all participant token holders will steer the course of the proxy's criteria and how it will vote. <br />
This is an ambitious goal, and attaining it will be slow and needs lots of thought and development.   </p>
<br />
<h2>Rating Criteria:</h2>
The candidate list will change constantly as we evaluate all Block Producers that have strong combinations of the following criteria:<br /><br />

<b>- Compliance</b><br />
Block Producer Requirements. Agreement with EOS constitution. Code of Conduct. Complete bp.json<br />
<b>Complete compliance is required to be considered for inclusion in the proxy list.</b> <br />
 <br />
 <b>- Independence</b><br />
Self-Funded, no third party liabilities.</b> <br />
 <br />
 <b>- Geopolitical Diversity  </b><br />
Balanced geographical and political diversity. Candidates will be chosen from all main world regions.   <br />
<br />
<b>- Transparency</b><br />
Disclosure of Ownership & Use of Rewards. <br />
<br />
<b>- Infrastructure Control & Resilience</b><br />
Physical access and management of infrastructure.<br />
<br />
<b>- EOS Software Testing & Enhancement</b><br />
Participation in Test nets, Debugging, Improvements.<br />
<br />
<b>- Democracy Tech Dapp Development and Promotion</b><br />
Government Transparency, Private Voting, Community Organization, Peer-to-peer Interaction, Censored-resistant Media, Surveillance-resistance, Identity & Data Sovereignty, Privacy Enhancements. <br />
<br />
<b>- Community Engagement</b><br />
Education and promotion of the EOS network. Talks, Chats, Hackatons, Conferences, Seminars, Developer Spaces & Retreats, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>The Fluid Positioning Concept:</h2>

We can divide the EOS BP's into 3 distinctive groups: <br />
<ol>
<li><b>Top 21 Bps</b></li>- Are actually producing the blocks and getting rewarded for it. <br />

<li><b>Standby Bps</b></li>- Do not produce blocks but get rewarded.<br />

<li><b>Non-Paid Bps</b></li>Do not produce blocks and don't get rewarded.<br />
</ol>
We believe it would be healthy for the EOS network to have a more dynamic up/down flow of BP's from these three groups, and that this movement would yield additional benefits for all BP's involved.
<ol>
    <li>All Standby BPs would get a higher probability to get a chance to actually perform their job, and gain necessary experience and readiness.</li>
    <li>Active producing BPs can gain needed time "on the pits" for maintenance, hardware & software upgrades, cleaning & re-seating components, etc.</li>
</ol>
We pretend to apply an upward pressure from the lower BP groups to the Top21 so that they will "pop-down" and give other BP's a chance to perform as actual producers. <br />
By using a bottom-heavy numbers ratio we believe such pressure could be applied and thus cause a steady flow of BP's from the top positions down. <br />
This is what we call <i><b>"Fluid Positioning"</b></i>. A simple ratio concept we are incorporating into the mechanics used by the DemTech Proxy.  <br /><br />

We will initially use a ratio of 10/60/30 weighted to the middle group to stimulate <b><i>"Fluid Positioning"</i></b> the most. This ratio could be adjusted once experience has been acquired.<br />
<br />                                                                                                                                                                                                    <br />
In numbers the split would be:<br />
<ol>
    <li>Top 21 BP's get 10% = 3 BP's </li>
    <li>Standby BP's get 60% = 18 BP's</li>
    <li>Non-Paid BP's get 30% = 9 BP's </li>
</ol>
<br />
So the selection procedure will be:
<ol>
<li>Select 40+ BPs with strong combinations of the main criteria detailed above.</li>
<li>Reduce the BPs list to 30 according to the "Fluid Positioning" ratio chosen. </li>
</ol>
<br />
<b>Caveats:</b>
<ol>
    <li>This scheme would only be effective if the DemTech Proxy gets enough support from the community token holders to have a significant impact otherwise the influence would be null.</li>
    <li>The list will have to be updated periodically so it can stimulate up/down flow of BPs.  This will be done automatically once we make progress with development.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Personal Background: </h2>

I graduated from Tulane University in 1973 having studied Mechanical Engineering and Philosophy. <br />
 <br />
While studying Engineering, I got introduced to computer programming using Fortran IV in the school's IBM mainframes. This is where my passion for reseaching and applying computer technology started and persists until now.<br />
<br />
During those college years, I built my own Ham Radio rig to communicate with family and friends at home. That was my first experience with decentralized communications networks, way before the invention of the Internet.<br />
<br />
In 1987 I established a software development company: <a href="http://www.edenia.com" target="_blank" title="Sistemas Edenia Internacional">Sistemas Edenia Internacional</a>) and programmed business software in dBase and Clipper for 13 years.<br />
<br />
Due to the Y2K problem and seeing the Internet phenomenon rising, we switched the company's focus exclusively to Internet.  <br />
Our first registered Internet domain edenia.com marks the year as 1995. <br />
We have been in the Internet hosting and development business ever since providing  hardware, programming, maintenance, and technical support to our customers worldwide.<br />
<br />
In early 2013, I discovered Bitcoin. It was another "this is going to change the world" moment and my enthusiasm grew to same levels as when I finally understood the Internet ;) <br />
Being an Internet company, it was a "no brainer" to incorporate "Internet Money" as a way of payment for our services.  <br />
We are now running and maintaining several BTC full nodes, DASH Masternodes, Stellar, Gricoin, and ZenCash nodes for customers and ourselves. <br />
<br />
I encountered Bitshares in 2015 after the M.T.Gox Exchange collapse and have been using the platform ever since.  <br />
I ran a Steem witness for over 3 months starting in 2016. If curious, see my Steem blog to discover what happened.<br />
After mastering BitShares and Steem usage, I gained a lot of respect and admiration for Dan Larimer as a software engineer and share a similar philosophical posture.  <br />
Thus my enthusiasm for Dan's latest creation: <b>The EOS Operating System</b>. <br />
<br />
I'm a passionate advocate and reader of Political Philosophy and Economics. <br />
I was born and live in Costa Rica and remain active in the local and international Blockchain communities.  <br />
