<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;">"Empowering
the
individual beyond trust"</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br>
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;"><big>Philosophy:</big><br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Blockchain Technology and
programmable peer-to-peer networks
like EOS make trust in political and third-party intermediation
unnecessary. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">We now have the opportunity to create
the environment and code in EOS
that will facilitate the achievement of **"Individual Sovereignty"**
for all people of the world.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Democracy Tech Proxy</span> will
vote for 30 Block producers that
pursue all individual's rights for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Life</span>,&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Liberty</span>,&nbsp; <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Property</span>,
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Privacy</span>.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">We will aim at attaining&nbsp;
"Liquid Democracy" where the "Wisdom" of all participant token
holder&nbsp; will steer the course of the proxy and how it will vote. <br>
This is an ambitious goal and attaining it will be slow and needs losts
of thought and development. <br>
<br>
The candidate
list will change constanttly as we periodically evaluate all Block
Producers that
have strong combinations of the following criteria:</span><br

<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<big style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;">The Fluid
Positioning Concept: <br>
<br>
</big><span style="font-family: Arial;">We can divide the EOS BP's into
3 distintive groups: </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Top 21 BPs - Are actually
producing the blocks and getting rewarded
for it. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Standby BPs - Do not produce
blocks but get rewarded. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Non-Paid BPs - Do not produce
blocks and don't get rewarded. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"></span><span
style="font-family: Arial;"></span><big
style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;"><br>
</big><span style="font-family: Arial;">We beleive it would be healthy
for
the EOS network to have a more
dynamic up/down flow of BP's from these three groups, and that this
movement would yield additional benefits for all BP's involved.
<br>
</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. All Standby BPs would get a
higher
probability to get a chance to
actually perform their job, and gain necessary experience and
readyness. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Active producing BPs can gain
needed time "on the pits" for
maintenance, hardware &amp; software upgrades, cleaning &amp;
re-seating components, etc.
<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">We pretend to apply an
upward pressure from the lower BP
groups to the Top21 so that they will "pop-down" and give other BP's a
chance to perform as actual producers. By using a bottom-heavy numbers
ratio we beleive such pressure could be applied and thus cause a steady
flow of BP's from the top positions down. </span><br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
This is what we call "Fluid
Positioning". A simple ratio concept we are
incorporating into the mechanics used by the DemTech Proxy. </span><br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;"></span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">We pretend to apply an

By using a bottom-heavy numbers
ratio we beleive such pressure could be applied and thus cause a steady
flow of BP's from the top positions down. </span><br
style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">We have decided to initially use a
ratio of
10/60/30 weighted to the
middle group would stimulate "Fluid Positioning" the most. This ratio
could be adjusted once experience has been aquired. </span><br
style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
In numbers the split would be: </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Top 21 BP's get 10% = 3 BP's </span><br
style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Standby BP's get 60% = 18 BP's
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Non-Paid BP's get 30% = 9 BP's
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">So the selection procedure will be:
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Select 40+ BP's with strong
combinations of the main criteria detailed
above.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Reduce the BPs list to 30
according to the "Fluid Positioning" ratio
chosen.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">Caveats:</span><br
style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">1. This scheme would only be
effective if the DemTech Proxy gets enough support from the community
token holders to have a significant impact otherwise the influence
would
be null.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">2. The list will have to be updated
periodically so it can stimulate
up/down flow of BPs.&nbsp; This will be done automatically once we make
progress&nbsp; with development. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

<big style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;">Personal
Background: </big><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">I graduated from Tulane University in
1973 with degrees in Mechanical
Engineering and Philosophy.
<br>
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">While studying Engineering, I got
introduced to computer programing
using Fortran IV in the school's IBM mainframes. This is where my
passion for studying and applying computer technology started and
persists until now. <br>
During those college years, I built my own Ham
Radio rig to communicate with family and friends at home. That was my
first experience with descentralized communications networks, way
before the invention of the Internet.
<br>
In 1987 I established a software development company: Sistemas Edenia
Internacional (http://www.edenia.com) and programmed business software
in dBase and Clipper for 13 years.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Due to the Y2K problem and seeing the
Internet phenomenom rising, we
switched the company's focus exclusively to Internet. <br>
Our first
registered Internet domain edenia.com marks the year as 1995.
<br>
We have been in the Internet hosting and development business ever
since providing&nbsp; hardware, programing, maintenance, and technical
support to our
customers worldwide.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
In early 2013, I discovered Bitcoin.
It was another "this is going to
change the world" moment and my enthusiam grew to same levels as when
I finaly understood the Internet ;)<br>
Being an Internet company, it was a
"no brainer" to incorporate "Internet Money" as a way of payment for
our services.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">We are now running and maintaining
several BTC full nodes, DASH
Masternodes, Stellar, Gricoin, and ZenCash nodes for customers and
ourselves.
<br>
I ran a Steem witness for over 3 months starting in 2016. If curious,
see my Steem blog to discover what happened.
<br>
I encountered Bitshares in 2015 after the M.T.Gox Exchange collapse and
have been using the platform ever since.
<br>
After mastering BitShares and Steem usage, I gained a lot of respect
and admiration for Dan Larimer as a software engineer and share a
similar philosophical posture. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Thus my enthusiam for Dan's latest
creation: <span style="font-weight: bold;">The EOS Operating
System</span>.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">I'm a pasionate advocate and reader
of Political Philosophy and
Economics.
<br>
I was born and live in Costa Rica and remain active in the local and
international Blockchain communities.<br>
