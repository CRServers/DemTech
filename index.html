<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;">"Empowering
the
individual beyond trust"</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;"><big>Philosophy:</big><br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Blockchain Technology and
programmable peer-to-peer networks
like EOS make trust in political and third-party intermediation
unnecessary. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">We now have the opportunity to create
the environment and code in EOS
that will facilitate the achievement of **"Individual Sovereignty"**
for all people of the world.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">**The Democracy Tech Proxy** will
vote for 30 Block producers that
pursue all individual's rights for **Life**, **Liberty**, **Property**,
and **Privacy**.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">We will aim at attaining&nbsp;
"Liquid Democracy" and the candidate
list will change as we periodically evaluate all Block Producers that
have strong combinations of the following criteria.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<big style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rating Criteria: </span></big><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">**- Compliance** Block Producer
Requirements. Agreement with EOS
constitution. Code of Conduct. Complete bp.json **Complete compliance
is required to be considered for inclusion in the proxy list.** **-
Independence** Self-Funded, no third party liabilities. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">**- GeoPolitical Diversity** Balanced
geographical and political
diversity.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">**- Transparency** Disclosure of
Ownership &amp; Use of Rewards. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">**- Infrastructure Control &amp;
Resilience** Physical access and
management of infrastructure.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">**- EOS Software Testing &amp;
Enhancement** Participation in Testnets,
Debuging, Improvements </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">**- Democracy Tech Dapp Development
and Promotion** </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Government
Transparency, Private Voting, Community Organization, Peer-to-peer
Interation, Censored-resistant Media, Surveillance-resistance, Identity
&amp; Data Sovereignty, Privacy Enhancement. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">**- Community Engagement** </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Education and promotion of the EOS
network. eg. Talks, Chats,
Hackatons, Conferences, Seminars, Developer Spaces &amp; Retreats,
etc.)
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<big style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;">The Fluid
Positioning Concept: <br>
<br>
</big><span style="font-family: Arial;">We can divide the EOS BP's into
3 distintive groups: </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Top 21 BPs - Are actually
producing the blocks and getting rewarded
for it. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Standby BPs - Do not produce
blocks but get rewarded. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Non-Paid BPs - Do not produce
blocks and don't get rewarded. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">We beleive it would be healthy for
the EOS network to have a more
dynamic up/down flow of BP's from these three groups, and that this
movement would yield additional benefits for all BP's involved.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">1. All Standby BPs would get a higher
probability to get a chance to
actually perform their job, and gain necessary experience and
readyness. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Active producing BPs can gain
needed time "on the pits" for
maintenance, hardware &amp; software upgrades, cleaning &amp;
re-seating components, etc.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">This is what we call "Fluid
Positioning". A simple ratio concept we are
incorporating into the mechanics used by the DemTech Proxy. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">For this to work, we have to apply an
upward pressure from the lower BP
groups to the Top21 so that they will "pop-down" and give other BP's a
chance to perform as actual producers. By using a bottom-heavy numbers
ratio we beleive such pressure could be applied and thus cause a steady
flow of BP's from the top positions down. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">We have initially concluded that a
10/60/30 ratio weighted to the
middle group would stimulate "Fluid Positioning" the most. This ratio
could be adjusted once experience has been aquired. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">In numbers the split would be: </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Top 21 BP's get 10% = 3 BP's </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Standby BP's get 60% = 18 BP's
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Non-Paid BP's get 30% = 9 BP's
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">So the selection procedure will be:
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Select 40+ BP's with strong
combinations of the Criteria detailed
above.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Reduce the BPs list to 30
according to the "Fluid Positioning" ratio
chosen.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">**Caveats:** </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">1. This scheme would only be
effective if the DemTech Proxy gets enough
traction from the community token holders otherwise the influence would
be null.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">2. The list will have to be updated
periodically so it can stimulate
up/down flow of BPs. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

<big style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;">Personal
Background: </big><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">I graduated from Tulane University in
1973 with degrees in Mechanical
Engineering and Philosophy.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">While studying Engineering, I got
introduced to computer programing
using Fortran IV in the school's IBM mainframes. This is where my
passion for studying and applying computer technology started and
persists until now. During those college years, I built my own Ham
Radio rig to communicate with family and friends at home. That was my
first experience with descentralized communications networks, way
before the invention of the Internet.
In 1987 I established a software development company: Sistemas Edenia
Intenacional (http://www.edenia.com) and programmed business software
in dBase and Clipper for 13 years.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Due to the Y2K problem and seeing the
Internet phenomenom rising, we
switched the company's focus exclusively to Internet. Our first
registered Internet domain edenia.com marks the year as 1995.
We have been in the Internet hosting and development business ever
since providing hardware, programing, maintenance, and support to our
customers worldwide.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">In early 2013, I discovered Bitcoin.
It was another "this is going to
change the world" moment and my enthusiams grew to same levels as when
I finaly understood the Internet. Being an Internet company, it was a
"no brainer" to incorporate "Internet Money" as a way of payment for
our services.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">We are now running and maintaining
several BTC full nodes, DASH
Masternodes, Stellar, Gricoin, and ZenCash nodes for customers and
ourselves.
I ran a Steem witness for over 3 months starting in 2016. If curious,
see my Steem blog to discover what happened.
I encountered Bitshares in 2015 after the M.T.Gox Exchange collapse and
have been using the platform ever since.
After mastering BitShares and Steem usage, I gained a lot of respect
and admiration for Dan Larimer as a software engineer and share a
similar philosophical posture. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Thus my enthusiam for Dan's latest
creation: **The EOS Operating
System**.
</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">I'm a pasionate advocate and reader
of Political Philosophy and
Economics.
I was born and live in Costa Rica and remain active in the local and
international Blockchain communities.
