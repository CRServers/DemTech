# Democracy Tech EOS Proxy
**"Enpowering the individual beyond trust"**


## Philosophy: ##
Blockchain Technology and programable peer-to-peer networks like EOS make trust in political and third-party intermediation unnecessary.

**The Democracy Tech Proxy**  will vote for 30 Block producers that exemplify, pursue, and preserve all individual's rights for **Life**, **Liberty**, **Property**, and **Privacy**.

We aspire to promote an enviroment in EOS that will facilitate the achievement of **"Individual Sovereinty"** for all people of the world.

We specifically look for Block Producers that are determined to provide the **Infrastructure** , **Tools**, and **Education** necessary to achive such goals using the EOS network.

Our Block Producer Candidates will be chosen using this Rating Criteria:

**- Independent**
	Self-Funded, No third party involvement, Democracy-driven juristictions

**- GeoPolitical Diversity**  
	Balanced Geographical location of all 30 chosen candidates.

**- Transparency**    
 	Disclosure of Ownership, Disclosure of use of rewards earned.

**- Infrastructure Control**
	Direct physical access and management of their network's infrastructure. 
	
**- DemTech Dapp Development**  
	We prefer Block Producers that produce and promote Democracy Tech Dapps. 
	eg. Government Transparency and Honesty, Private Voting, Community Organization, Peer-to-peer Interation,
	Uncensored Free Media, Surveillance Resistance, Privacy Enhancement, etc)     

**-  Community Engagement**  
 	Promotes education and adoption of the EOS network guided by the above principles. 
	eg. Talks, Chats, Hackatons, Conferences, Seminars, Developer Spaces & Retreats, etc.)
	

## Background: ##
I Graduated from Tulane University in 1973 with degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Philosophy.

While studying Engineering, I got introduced to computer programing using Fortran IV in IBM frameworks. 
This is where my passion for computer science and all related fields started.

During those years at Tulane I built my own Ham Radio rig to communicate with family and friends at home. That was my first experience with descentralized communications.

In 1987 I established a software development company: Sistemas Edenia Intenacional. http://www.edenia.com and programmed business software in dBase and Clipper.

Due to the Y2K problem, we switched our company's focus exclusively to Internet in 1995 when our first domain edenia.com was registered.

We have been in the Internet Hosting and Web development business ever since providing hardware infrastruture and programing to customers worldwide.

In early 2013, I discovered Bitcoin and was heavily bitten by the "Crypto worm". We promptly adopted Bitcoin as a form of payment for our services.

We are now running several BTC full nodes, DASH Masternodes, Stellar, Gricoin and ZenCash nodes for customers and ourselves.
I ran a Steem witness for over 3 months starting in 2016.

I discovered Bitshares in 2015 after the M.T.Gox Exchange collapse and have a lifetime membership with OpenLedger.
After using BitShares and Steem, I've gained lots of respect for Dan Larimer as a outstanding software engineer, thus my attraction to Dan's latest product EOS.

I'm a pasionate advocate and reader of Libertarian Philosophy and Austrian Economics.

I was born and live in Costa Rica and remain very active in the local Costa Rican crypto community.
