# Democracy Tech EOS Proxy
**"Empowering the individual beyond trust"**


## Philosophy: ##
Blockchain Technology and programmable peer-to-peer networks like EOS make trust in political and third-party intermediation unnecessary.  

We now have the opportunity  to create the environment and code in EOS that will facilitate the achievement of **"Individual Sovereignty"** for all people of the world.

**The Democracy Tech Proxy**  will vote for 30 Block producers that pursue all individual's rights for **Life**, **Liberty**, **Property**, and **Privacy**.

We will pursue "Liquid Democracy" and the candidate list will change as we periodically evaluate all Block Producers that have strong combinations of the following criteria.

## Rating Criteria: ##  

**- Independence**   
	Self-Funded, or third party involvement. 

**- GeoPolitical Diversity**  
	Balanced geographical and political diversity.

**- Transparency**    
 	 Disclosure of Ownership & Use of Rewards. Complete bp.json

**- Infrastructure Control & Resilience**   
	Physical access and management of infrastructure.

**- EOS Software Testing & Enhancement**  
	Participation in Testnets, Debuging, Improvements
	
**- Democracy Tech Dapp Development and Promotion**  
	Eg. Government Transparency, Private Voting, Community Organization, Peer-to-peer Interation,
	Censored-resistant Media,  Surveillance-resistance, Identity & Data Sovereignty, Privacy Enhancement.    

**-  Community Engagement**  
 	Education and promotion of the EOS network. 
	eg. Talks, Chats, Hackatons, Conferences, Seminars, Developer Spaces & Retreats, etc.)
	
**- Compliance**  
Block Producer Requirements. Agreement with EOS constitution.

## The Fluid Positioning Concept ##

We can divide the EOS BP's into 3 distintive groups:
1 - Top 21 BPs 		- Are actually producing the blocks and getting rewarded for it.
2 - Standby BPs 	- Do not produce blocks but get rewarded.
3 - Non-Paid BPs 	- Do not produce blocks and don't get rewarded. 

We beleive it would be healthy for the EOS network have more dynamic flow of BP's up/down from these three groups.
If this flow of positions could be increased, it would be beneficial for all BP's involved.
1- All Standby BPs would get a higher probability to get a chance to actually perform their job, and gain necessary experience and readyness.
2- Active producing BPs can gain needed time "on the pits" for maintenance, hardware & software upgrades, cleaning & re-seating componets, etc.

This is what we call "Fluid Positioning". A concept we will be incorporating into the Criteria used by the DemTech Proxy.
We would balance the list with the formula 20-60-20. That is Top BP's get 20% = 6 BP's, Standby BP's get 60% = 18 BP's, and Non-Paid BP's get 20% = 6 BP's
So those percentages of each group with strong combinations of the rest of the Criteria will be selected to the DemTech Proxy list.
After calculations, we concluded that a 20/60/20 ratio weighted to the middle group would stimulate "Fluid Positioning" the most.

This scheme would only be effective if the Proxy gets enough traction from the community token holders
	

## Background: ##
I graduated from Tulane University in 1973 with degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Philosophy.

While studying Engineering, I got introduced to computer programing using Fortran IV in the school's IBM mainframes. 
This is where my passion for studying and applying computer technology started and persists until now. 

During those college years, I built my own Ham Radio rig to communicate with family and friends at home. That was my first experience with descentralized communications networks, way before the invention of the Internet.

In 1987 I established a software development company: Sistemas Edenia Intenacional (http://www.edenia.com) and programmed business software in dBase and Clipper for 13 years.

Due to the Y2K problem and seeing the Internet phenomenom rising, we switched the company's focus exclusively to Internet. Our first registered Internet domain edenia.com marks the year as 1995.

We have been in the Internet hosting and development business ever since providing hardware, programing, maintenance, and support to our customers worldwide.

In early 2013, I discovered Bitcoin. It was another "this is going to change the world" moment and my enthusiams grew to same levels as when I finaly understood the Internet. Being an Internet company, it was a "no brainer" to incorporate "Internet Money" as a way of payment for our services.

We are now running and maintaining several BTC full nodes, DASH Masternodes, Stellar, Gricoin, and ZenCash nodes for customers and ourselves.
I ran a Steem witness for over 3 months starting in 2016. If curious, see my Steem blog to discover what happened.

I encountered Bitshares in 2015 after the M.T.Gox Exchange collapse and have been using the platform ever since.

After mastering BitShares and Steem usage, I gained a lot of respect and admiration for Dan Larimer as a software engineer and share a similar philosophical posture. Thus my enthusiam for Dan's latest creation: **The EOS Operating System**.

I'm a pasionate advocate and reader of Libertarian Philosophy and Austrian Economics.

I was born and live in Costa Rica and remain active in the local and international Blockchain communities.
