## Background: ##
I Graduated from Tulane University in 1973 with degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Philosophy.

While studying Engineering, I got introduced to computer programing using Fortran IV in IBM frameworks. 
This is where my passion for studying and applying computer technology started and persists until now. 

During those years at Tulane I built my own Ham Radio rig to communicate with family and friends at home. That was my first experience with descentralized communications networks.

In 1987 I established a software development company: Sistemas Edenia Intenacional. http://www.edenia.com and programmed business software in dBase and Clipper for 13 years.

Due to the Y2K problem and seeing the Internet phenomenom rising, we switched our company's focus exclusively to Internet in 1995 when our first domain edenia.com was registered.

We have been in the Internet Hosting and Web development business ever since providing hardware infrastruture and programing to customers worldwide.

In early 2013, I discovered Bitcoin. It was another "this is going to change the world" moment and my enthusiams grew to same level as when I understood the Internet. Being and Internet company, we promptly adopted "Internet Money" as a form of payment for our services.

We are now running and manteining several BTC full nodes, DASH Masternodes, Stellar, Gricoin and ZenCash nodes for customers and ourselves.
I ran a Steem witness for over 3 months starting in 2016. If curious, see my Steem blog to discover what happened.

I discovered Bitshares in 2015 after the M.T.Gox Exchange collapse and started using the platform.

After mastering BitShares and Steem usage, I gained a lot of respect and admiration for Dan Larimer as a software engineer and share most of his philosophical postures. Thus my enthusiam for Dan's latest creation: The EOS Operating System.

I'm a pasionate advocate and reader of Libertarian Philosophy and Austrian Economics.

I was born and live in Costa Rica and remain active in the local and international Blockchain communities.
