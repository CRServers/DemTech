# Democracy Tech EOS Proxy
**"Empowering the individual beyond trust"**


## Philosophy: ##
Blockchain Technology and programmable peer-to-peer networks like EOS make trust in political and third-party intermediation unnecessary.  

We now have the opportunity  to create the environment and code in EOS that will facilitate the achievement of **"Individual Sovereignty"** for all people of the world.

**The Democracy Tech Proxy**  will vote for 30 Block producers that pursue all individual's rights for **Life**, **Liberty**, **Property**, and **Privacy**.

We will pursue "Liquid Democracy" and the candidate list will change as we periodically evaluate all Block Producers that have strong combinations of the following criteria.

## Rating Criteria: ##  
**- Independence**   
	Self-Funded, or third party involvement. 

**- GeoPolitical Diversity**  
	Balanced geographical and political diversity.

**- Transparency**    
 	 Disclosure of Ownership & Use of Rewards. Complete bp.json

**- Infrastructure Control & Resilience**   
	Physical access and management of infrastructure.

**- EOS Software Testing & Enhancement**  
	Participation in Testnets, Debuging, Improvements
	
**- Democracy Tech Dapp Development and Promotion**  
	Eg. Government Transparency, Private Voting, Community Organization, Peer-to-peer Interation,
	Censored-resistant Media,  Surveillance-resistance, Identity & Data Sovereignty, Privacy Enhancement.    

**-  Community Engagement**  
 	Education and promotion of the EOS network. 
	eg. Talks, Chats, Hackatons, Conferences, Seminars, Developer Spaces & Retreats, etc.)
	
**- Compliance**  
Block Producer Requirements. Agreement with EOS constitution. Code of Conduct. Complete bp.json
Note: Compliance is required to be considered for inclusion in the proxy list. 


## The Fluid Positioning Concept: ##
We can divide the EOS BP's into 3 distintive groups:
 
1. Top 21 BPs	- Are actually producing the blocks and getting rewarded for it.  
2. Standby BPs 	- Do not produce blocks but get rewarded.  
3. Non-Paid BPs	- Do not produce blocks and don't get rewarded. 

We beleive it would be healthy for the EOS network to have more dynamic up/down flow of BP's from these three groups, and that this movement would yield additional benefits for all BP's involved.

1. All Standby BPs would get a higher probability to get a chance to actually perform their job, and gain necessary experience and readyness. 
2. Active producing BPs can gain needed time "on the pits" for maintenance, hardware & software upgrades, cleaning & re-seating components, etc.

This is what we call "Fluid Positioning". A simple ratio concept we are incorporating into the mechanics used by the DemTech Proxy.
For this to work, we have to apply an upward pressure from the lower BP groups to the Top21 so that they will "pop-down" and give other BP's a chance to perform as actual producers.
By using a numbers ratio we beleive such pressure could be applied and thus cause the a steady flow of BP's from the top positions down.  

We have concluded that a 10/60/30 ratio weighted to the middle group would stimulate "Fluid Positioning" the most, but this will  change with experience.
In numbers the split would be: 
1. Top 21 BP's get 10% = 3 BP's 
2. Standby BP's get 60% = 18 BP's
3. Non-Paid BP's get 30% = 9 BP's

So the selection procedure will be:
1. Select BP's with strong combinations of the Criteria detailed above (40+ BPs).
2. Reduce the BPs list to 30 according to the "Fluid Positioning" ratio explained above.

**Caveats:** 
1. This scheme would only be effective if the DemTech Proxy gets enough traction from the community token holders otherwise the influence would be null.
2. The list will have to be updated periodically so it can stimulate up/down flow of BPs.
	

## Personal Background: ##
I graduated from Tulane University in 1973 with degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Philosophy.

While studying Engineering, I got introduced to computer programing using Fortran IV in the school's IBM mainframes. 
This is where my passion for studying and applying computer technology started and persists until now. 

During those college years, I built my own Ham Radio rig to communicate with family and friends at home. That was my first experience with descentralized communications networks, way before the invention of the Internet.

In 1987 I established a software development company: Sistemas Edenia Intenacional (http://www.edenia.com) and programmed business software in dBase and Clipper for 13 years.

Due to the Y2K problem and seeing the Internet phenomenom rising, we switched the company's focus exclusively to Internet. Our first registered Internet domain edenia.com marks the year as 1995.

We have been in the Internet hosting and development business ever since providing hardware, programing, maintenance, and support to our customers worldwide.

In early 2013, I discovered Bitcoin. It was another "this is going to change the world" moment and my enthusiams grew to same levels as when I finaly understood the Internet. Being an Internet company, it was a "no brainer" to incorporate "Internet Money" as a way of payment for our services.

We are now running and maintaining several BTC full nodes, DASH Masternodes, Stellar, Gricoin, and ZenCash nodes for customers and ourselves.
I ran a Steem witness for over 3 months starting in 2016. If curious, see my Steem blog to discover what happened.

I encountered Bitshares in 2015 after the M.T.Gox Exchange collapse and have been using the platform ever since.

After mastering BitShares and Steem usage, I gained a lot of respect and admiration for Dan Larimer as a software engineer and share a similar philosophical posture. Thus my enthusiam for Dan's latest creation: **The EOS Operating System**.

I'm a pasionate advocate and reader of Libertarian Philosophy and Austrian Economics.

I was born and live in Costa Rica and remain active in the local and international Blockchain communities.
