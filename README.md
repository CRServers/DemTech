## Background: ##
I graduated from Tulane University in 1973 with degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Philosophy.

While studying Engineering, I got introduced to computer programing using Fortran IV in the school's IBM mainframes. 
This is where my passion for studying and applying computer technology started and persists until now. 

During those college years, I built my own Ham Radio rig to communicate with family and friends at home. That was my first experience with descentralized communications networks, way before the invention of the Internet.

In 1987 I established a software development company: Sistemas Edenia Intenacional (http://www.edenia.com) and programmed business software in dBase and Clipper for 13 years.

Due to the Y2K problem and seeing the Internet phenomenom rising, we switched the company's focus exclusively to Internet. Our first registered Internet domain edenia.com marks the year as 1995.

We have been in the Internet hosting and development business ever since providing hardware, programing, maintenance, and support to our customers worldwide.

In early 2013, I discovered Bitcoin. It was another "this is going to change the world" moment and my enthusiams grew to same levels as when I finaly understood the Internet. Being an Internet company, it was a "no brainer" to incorporate "Internet Money" as a way of payment for our services.

We are now running and maintaining several BTC full nodes, DASH Masternodes, Stellar, Gricoin, and ZenCash nodes for customers and ourselves.
I ran a Steem witness for over 3 months starting in 2016. If curious, see my Steem blog to discover what happened.

I encountered Bitshares in 2015 after the M.T.Gox Exchange collapse and have been using the platform ever since.

After mastering BitShares and Steem usage, I gained a lot of respect and admiration for Dan Larimer as a software engineer and share a similar philosophical posture. Thus my enthusiam for Dan's latest creation: **The EOS Operating System**.

I'm a pasionate advocate and reader of Libertarian Philosophy and Austrian Economics.

I was born and live in Costa Rica and remain active in the local and international Blockchain communities.
